	                        	Human security means having protection against unpredictable events that disrupt
								lives and livelihoods. Few resources have a more critical bearing on human security
								than water. As a productive resource, water is essential in maintaining the livelihoods
								of the world’s most vulnerable people. But water also has destructive properties,
								as witnessed by storms and floods. Security in access to water as a productive
								input and protection against the vulnerabilities associated with uncertainty in water
								flows is one of the keys to human development.
	                        </p>
	                        <p>
	                        	Perceptions of water security today are heavily
								influenced by ideas about scarcity. Shortages of
								water are widely perceived as the defining feature
								of water insecurity. Concerns that the world is
								“running out of water” are aired with growing
								frequency. But scarcity is both a distorting and
								limiting lens for viewing water insecurity. It is
								distorting because much of what passes for scarcity
								is a policy-induced consequence of mismanaging
								water resources. And it is limiting because
								physical availability is only one dimension of
								water insecurity.

	                        	“Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to
								drink,” laments the sailor in Samuel Coleridge’s
								Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The observation
								remains a useful first approximation for understanding
								the world’s supply of fresh water. Earth may be the water planet, but 97%
								of its water is in oceans.5 Most of the remainder
								is locked in Antarctic icecaps or deep underground,
								leaving less than 1% available for
								human use in easily accessible freshwater lakes
								and rivers. Unlike oil or coal, water is an infinitely
								renewable resource. In a natural cycle
								rainwater falls from the clouds, returns to the
								salty sea through freshwater rivers, and evaporates
								back to the clouds. The cycle explains
								why we cannot run out of water, but supply
								is finite. Planet Earth’s hydrological system
								pumps and transfers about 44,000 cubic kilometres
								of water to the land each year, equivalent
								to 6,900 cubic metres for everyone on the
								planet. A large part of this flow is accounted for
								by uncontrollable floodwaters, or water too remote
								for effective human use. Even so, the world
								has far more water than the 1,700 cubic metres
								per person minimum threshold that hydrologists
								by (admittedly arbitrary) convention treat
								as the amount needed to grow food, support industries
								and maintain the environment.
	                        </p>
	                        <p>
	                        	Unfortunately, the international average
								is a largely irrelevant number. At one level the
								world’s water is like the world’s wealth. Globally,
								there is more than enough to go round: the
								problem is that some countries get a lot more
								than others. Almost a quarter of the world’s supply
								of fresh water is in Lake Baikal in sparsely
								populated Siberia.7 Differences in availability
								across and within regions further highlight the
								distribution problem. With 31% of global freshwater
								resources, Latin America has 12 times
								more water per person than South Asia. Some
								places, such as Brazil and Canada, get far more
								water than they can use; others, such as countries
								in the Middle East, get much less than
								they need. Water-stressed Yemen (198 cubic
								metres per person) is not helped by Canada’s
								overabundance of fresh water (90,000 cubic
								metres per person). And water-stressed regions
								in China and India are not relieved by Iceland’s
								water availability of more than 300 times the
								1,700 cubic metre threshold.

						   <h4 class = "newSection">Dealing with risk, vulnerability and uncertainty</h4>
						   <p>
							   	The physical availability of water is one dimension
								of scarcity. But in all countries the relationship
								between water security and water availability
								is mediated through the infrastructure and
								institutions that govern water. Countries vary
								enormously in their capacity in these areas, with
								implications for water security. Nowhere are
								those implications more apparent than in the
								threat of global warming—a threat that can be
								addressed only through a strong infrastructure
								base that facilitates adaptation.
							</p>
							<h4 class = "newSection">Mitigating risk in rich countries</h4>
							<p>
								The sheer scale of water infrastructure investment
								in rich countries is not widely appreciated.
								Investments in hydraulic infrastructure have in
								some cases generated great environmental damage,
								but they have also supported economic
								prosperity and social progress.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the United States many of the largest
								federal investments in history were made to
								store water, harness it for electricity and curb
								the potential for floods. By one estimate the
								US Army Corps of Engineers has spent $200
								billion since 1920 on flood management and
								mitigation alone (yielding a benefit of about
								$700 billion).64 The Tennessee Valley Authority,
								established in 1933 as part of the New Deal
								to build dams, hydropower facilities and reservoirs,
								transformed the Tennessee Valley from
								a flood-prone, impoverished part of the Dust
								Bowl, with some of the worst human development
								indicators in the United States, to an area
								of agricultural prosperity. The cycle of rural
								poverty afflicting more than 2 million people in
								one of the poorest regions of the United States
								was broken in a generation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Risk mitigation in water management
								through flood control systems and development
								of an economic infrastructure has been
								fundamental to human progress in many rich
								countries. Nowhere is this more evident than
								in Japan, where heavy post-war investments in
								infrastructure supported the rapid development
								of hydropower, flood control and irrigated agriculture.
								Until World War II flooding caused
								by heavy seasonal rains and typhoons had enormously
								detrimental effects on the Japanese
								economy, with losses sometimes exceeding 20%
								of GNI. Since the 1970s the impacts of floods
								have never exceeded 1% of GNI.66 Most of Japan’s
								population and 60% of its productive assets
								are on low-lying plains vulnerable to flooding,
								but infrastructure and water management
								have curtailed risk at an average cost of about
								$9 billion a year.
