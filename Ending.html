                        	<p>The Millennium Development Goals, set by the world’s leaders
                        	    at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, aim at halving the 
                        	    proportion of people without access to safe water and sanitation by 2015.
                        	</p>
                        	
                        	<p>• A progress report on the Millennium Development Goal target</p>
                        	
                        	
                        	<p>Over the next decade the population of developing countries is 
                        	    projected grow by 830 million. This means the simple version 
                        	    of the Millennium Development Goal challenge will have to least 
                        	    cater for an additional 900 million people need access to water 
                        	    and 1.3 billion people need access to sanitation by 2015. Many 
                        	    of the world’s poorest countries are demonstrating through practical 
                        	    achievements that the Millennium Development Goal target is within reach.

                        	<p>• Savings from meeting the Millennium Development Goal target</p>
                        	
                        	<p>The cost that changes the current global scope depends on the level 
                        	   and type of technology and about the costs of delivery. Unreliable 
                        	   data make global estimation hazardous, but there is a surprisingly 
                        	   high level of agreement across various research exercises. Current 
                        	   spending on water and sanitation in developing countries is estimated 
                        	   at $14–$16 billion annually (excluding wastewater treatment). The broad 
                        	   consensus on the additional financing required to achieve the Millennium 
                        	   Development Goal target on the basis of low-cost sustainable technologies 
                        	   is about $10 billion annually. The $10 billion required annually to get 
                        	   the world on track for the 2015 goal represents about eight days of 
                        	   global military spending. The price tag for achieving the Millennium 
                        	   Development Goal is money investment. That investment has the potential 
                        	   to save more than 1 million lives over the next decade, to end the crushing 
                        	   waste of lost education potential and to act as a catalyst for economic growth.

                           <div>
                            <p>The ultimate goal in water and sanitation is universal access. Effective 
                               political leadership in most countries have the potential to surpass the target 
                               and move rapidly towards universal provision. The levels of provision required to
                               meet the criterion for improved access should be seen as the first. If everyone has 
                               access to the most basic technologies would make a huge difference. In the rich 
                               world, people in developing countries have a right to aspire to systems of 
                               provision that include piped water in their homes, access to networks for sanitation 
                           	   provision and a water and sanitation infrastructure that includes a capacity to process 
                           	   wastewater. While these aims may not be immediately achievable in many countries, it is 
                               important that public policies work progressively towards their realization. 
							   Investments and policies put in place today will take several years to produce 
							   results on the scale required. The focus is on some of the core policies and broad 
							   approaches needed in four areas that represent the foundations for future progress:<br>
							   • Human rights<br>
							   • National strategies<br>
							   • International aid<br>
							   • A global action plan for water and sanitation.<br>
