							  <p>Four voices from four countries united by a single
								theme: deprivation in access to water. That
								deprivation can be measured by statistics, but
								behind the numbers are the human faces of the
								millions of people denied an opportunity to realize
								their potential. Water, the stuff of life and a
								basic human right, is at the heart of a daily crisis
								faced by countless millions of the world's most
								vulnerable people-a crisis that threatens life
								and destroys livelihoods on a devastating scale.
								</p>
								<p>
								Overcoming the crisis in water and sanitation
								is one of the great human development
								challenges of the early 21st century. Success in
								addressing that challenge through a concerted
								national and international response would act
								as a catalyst for progress in public health, education
								and poverty reduction and as a source of
								economic dynamism. It would give a decisive
								impetus to the Millennium Development
								Goals—the targets adopted by governments as
								part of a global partnership for poverty reduction.
								The business as usual alternative is to tolerate
								a level of avoidable suffering and loss of
								human potential that all governments should
								regard as ethically indefensible and economically
								wasteful.
								</p>	
								<h2 class= "text-center">The Millennium Development Goals</h2>
								<p>
								The Millennium Development Goals provide
								a benchmark for measuring progress towards
								the human right to water. That is why
								halving the proportion of world population
								without sustainable access to safe drinking
								water and basic sanitation-Goal 7, target 10-
								is a key target in its own right. But achieving
								that target is critical to the attainment of other
								goals. Clean water and sanitation would save
								the lives of countless children, support progress
								in education and liberate people from the illnesses
								that keep them in poverty.</p>
								<!--Creates 8 panels within the main panel-->
								<div class="panel panel-primary">
								  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</div>
								  <div class="panel-body">- The absence of clean water and adequate sanitation is a major cause of poverty and malnutrition<br>
								  	- Water is a vital productive input for the smallholder farmers who account for more than half of the world’s population living on less than $1 a day.<br>
								  	- Mounting pressure to reallocate water from agriculture to industry threatens to increase rural poverty.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="panel panel-info">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- Collecting water and carrying it over long distances keep millions of girls out of school, consigning them to a future of illiteracy and restricted choice.<br>     
							  	- Water-related diseases such as diarrhoea and parasitic 
							  	infections cost 443 million school days each year—
								equivalent to an entire school year for all seven-year-old
								children in Ethiopia—and diminish learning potential.<br>
								- Inadequate water and sanitation provision in schools in
								many countries is a threat to child health.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-primary">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- Deprivation in water and sanitation perpetuates gender
								inequality and disempowers women.<br>
								- Women bear the brunt of responsibility for collecting water,
								often spending up to 4 hours a day walking, waiting in
								queues and carrying water. This is a major source of time
								poverty.<br>
								- The time women spend caring for children made ill by
								waterborne diseases diminishes their opportunity to engage
								in productive work.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-info">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 4: Reduce child mortality</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- Dirty water and poor sanitation account for the vast majority
								of the 1.8 million child deaths each year from diarrhoea-
								almost 5,000 every day-making it the second largest
								cause of child mortality.<br>
								-Access to clean water and sanitation can reduce the risk of
								a child dying by as much as 50%<br>
								-Clean water and sanitation are among the most powerful
								preventative measures for child mortality: achieving the
								Millennium Development Goal for water and sanitation at
								even the most basic level of provision would save more than
								1 million lives in the next decade; universal provision would
								raise the number of lives saved to 2 million.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-primary">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 5: Improve maternal health</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">-The provision of water and sanitation reduces the incidence
								of diseases and afflictions—such as anaemia, vitamin
								deficiency and trachoma—that undermine maternal health
								and contribute to maternal mortality.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-info">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- Inadequate access to water and sanitation restricts opportunities
								for hygiene and exposes people with HIV/AIDS to
								increased risks of infection.<br>
								- HIV-infected mothers require clean water to make formula
								milk.<br>
								- Achieving the Millennium Development Goal target for water
								and sanitation would reduce the costs to health systems of
								treating water-related infectious diseases by $1.7 billion,
								increasing the resources available for HIV/AIDS treatment.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-primary">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability - Halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- The goal of halving the proportion of people without access
								to water and sanitation will be missed on current trends
								by 234 million people for water and 430 million people for
								sanitation.<br>
								- Sub-Saharan Africa will need to increase new connections
								for sanitation from 7 million a year for the past decade to 28
								million a year by 2015.<br>
								- Slow progress in water and sanitation will hold back
								advances in other areas.</div>
							</div>
							<div class="panel panel-info">
							  <div class="panel-heading">Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development</div>
							  <div class="panel-body">- There is no effective global partnership for water and sanitation,
								and successive high-level conferences have failed to
								create the momentum needed to push water and sanitation
								in the international agenda.<br>
								- Many national governments are failing to put in place the
								policies and financing needed to accelerate progress.<br>
								- Water and sanitation is weakly integrated into Poverty
								Reduction Strategy Papers.</div>
							</div>
								<p>
								The urgency of achieving the Millennium
								Development Goal for water and sanitation
								cannot be overstated. Even if the targets are
								achieved, there will still be more than 800 million
								people without water and 1.8 billion people
								without sanitation in 2015. Yet despite progress
								the world is falling short of what is needed, especially
								in the poorest countries. Changing this
								picture will require sustained action over the
								next decade allied to a decisive break with the
								current business as usual model.
